âœ… How to Use the Snake GitHub Contribution Animation:

1. Upload the `.github/workflows/snake.yml` file into your GitHub profile repo (`Arihant-jainn/Arihant-jainn`).
   - You can drag and drop the folder manually on GitHub or use GitHub Desktop/CLI.

2. Do NOT delete or modify your existing README.md file.

3. Add the following line to the **bottom of your README.md** file to show the snake animation:

   ![Snake animation](https://github.com/Arihant-jainn/Arihant-jainn/blob/output/github-contribution-grid-snake.svg)

4. Go to the "Actions" tab on GitHub and run the "Generate Snake Animation" workflow once.

ðŸŽ‰ Done! The animation will auto-update every day.
